#Language and Memory with Patadata

It has come to my recent attention that various members of the hominids have themselves discover'd that the qualities or elements of patalogical differentiation. In saying this I mean to suggest that phenotypal complexity divides along the logical lines or fabric more akin to inconsistency, volatality, anomaly, rather than the traditionalist-rationalist logical frameworks fashionable within Western thought.

What brings such a biological feature of nature unto capacities of introspection? What must be admit'd in Leibniz's monadology, for instance, is the total homonotization of abilities. A species, say, in evolutionary explanations must only be said to have become enhanced through law-like descriptions which describe the whole system. In Godel or Cantor, we see what is the same thing, that differentation begins at the periphery of systems, yet what is paradoxical is that subvertive characters, nodes, items, obey spaceless limitations, or the theoretical position. The antidiagonal number is a procedure, we may say, that is applicable to reals, the naturals, all the same; what is more, it may so too appear patalogically across any abstractive term so used to render reference to the total list of any of these sui generis categories of organization of number.

We may think of aspects of the mind, of modules or subsystems of the brain as canonicalization procedures of organization. Like in Number Theory, certain labels for sets of logically similar numbers, the names themselves, of these numbers, exclude and obscure insight into disparate procedures of organization, like pi, again; we often times fail to perceive the connotative scope of historically antecedent conventional phrases or idioms: that the reals, for instance, are each in themselve an infinite decimal *expansion*. Here, we may observe the modules of the brain, which lend to various abilities and affinities, we may observe them as procedures for the organization of experience. A modern Cartesian might say here, in response, that the fabric of the mind is analogous to the grid of the brain in terms of their modal structures, in that they were are modes of attribute. Here I agree in that modality gives insight into the becoming of things.
